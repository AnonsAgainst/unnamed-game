# Unnamed Game
An experimental HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript-based text game interface which may
eventually also have a real game attached to it.

It's licensed under GPLv3, but I am not too religiously attached to the license,
so I may change it to something else if people ask. Please note that whatever
form it takes, it shall remain free (and open-source) software (at the very
least in any version I am responsible for).
