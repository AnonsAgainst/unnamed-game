Vampires are beings that live off of the essence of others. They are able to
exist for centuries if their food supply continues to.

Contrary to popular legend, Vampires are not evil, nor are they needlessly
cruel. They do what they have to to survive. In humans, a similar trait is
present in their relationship with livestock. As livestock is slaughtered
so humans can thrive, so humans are occasionally "harvested" so that vampires
may.

Vampires do not see humans as mere livestock, however. They were once humans
themselves, remember their times as humans, and participate in human culture.
Their thirst for blood is not a constant desire - merely something needed on
occasion to replenish their supplies. Without it, they can become anemic and
weak, because a side-effect of the spell they were enchanted by prevents their
blood cells from reproducing quickly enough to keep steady. They usually
hide their true natures while living among humans, for they are feared as
'unnatural' and have historically been persecuted for their affliction. They
are regarded by many to not even be humans any longer, but cruel imitations
of their former selves animated by dark magics. As it is impossible for one to
truly see the consciousness of another, this argument is not able to be
truly disproven for the same reasons that a theroetical artificial intelligence
cannot prove that it is capable of emotions to other beings.

Their spell (or curse, as it is seen my many humans) is transferrable to humans
and some other species by repeated bites, sharing needles, or sexual encounters.
All of these infection vectors are thought to be related to the sharing of
bodily fluids, leading some of the less religiously-minded population to suspect
that their blood is the carrier of the spell. They cite the low blood
reproduction rate as evidence that the blood is supplying the energy to
maintain the spell, and thus does not have enough energy left to replicate sufficiently.

The spell's origin is unknown, but vampires have been documented since near
the beginning of recorded history.
