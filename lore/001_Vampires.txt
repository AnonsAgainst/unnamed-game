Vampires are beings that live off of the essence of others. They are able to
exist for centuries if their food supply continues to.

Contrary to popular legend, Vampires are not evil, nor are they needlessly
cruel. They do what they have to to survive. In humans, a similar trait is
present in their relationship with livestock. As livestock is slaughtered
so humans can thrive, so humans are occasionally "harvested" so that vampires
may.

Vampires do not see humans as mere livestock, however. They were once humans
themselves, remember their times as humans, and participate in human culture.
Their thirst for blood is not a constant desire - merely something needed on
occasion to replenish their supplies. Without it, they can become anemic and
weak, because a side-effect of the spell they were enchanted by prevents their
blood cells from reproducing quickly enough to keep steady.
