= Vampire =

Vampires are beings that live off of the essence of others. They are able to
exist for centuries if their food supply continues to.

Contrary to popular legend, Vampires are not evil, nor are they needlessly
cruel. They do what they have to to survive. In humans, a similar trait is
present in their relationship with livestock. As livestock is slaughtered
so humans can thrive, so humans are occasionally "harvested" so that vampires
may.

Their signature thirst for blood is not a constant desire - merely something
needed on occasion to replenish their own supplies. Without it, they can become
anemic and weak, because a side-effect of the spell they were enchanted by
prevents their blood cells from reproducing quickly enough to maintain a healthy
level.

====Vampire-Human relations====
Vampires do not see humans as mere livestock, however. They were once humans
themselves, remember their times as humans, and participate in human culture.
They do so in secrecy, for their safety depends on it, and their lives depend
on being able to obtain blood.

They hide their true natures while living among humans, for they are feared as
'unnatural,' or even 'demonic,' and have historically been persecuted for their
affliction. They are regarded by a significant portion of the human population
to not even be humans any longer, but cruel imitations of their former selves
animated by dark magics.

Vampires have occasionally tried to prove that this is not the case after being
discovered in attempts to defend themselves, but this has a high failure rate.

It is impossible for one to truly understand the consciousness of another, even
between two humans, and so the theory that they are no longer who their bodies
identify them as cannot be truly disproven.
At some point, humans would have to take the vampires at their word, and many
are afraid to do that.


==== The Curse ====

Their spell (or curse, as it is seen my many humans) is transferrable to humans
and some other species by repeated bites, sharing needles, or sexual encounters.
All of these infection vectors are thought to be related to the sharing of
bodily fluids, leading some of the less religiously-minded population to suspect
that their blood is the carrier of the spell. They cite the low blood
reproduction rate as evidence that the blood is supplying the energy to
maintain the spell, and thus does not have enough energy left to replicate sufficiently.

The spell's origin is unknown, but vampires have been documented since near
the beginning of recorded history.

==== Abilities ====
Part of why vampires are so feared is their mastery of magics. Nearly all
vampires, after becoming afflicted, exhibit some magical abilities. Several -
like the ability to turn into a fog, seem to be natural abilities that become
instinctually controllable. Other abilities include:
 * Night vision - Vampires are particularly good at seeing in low light.
 * Hypnosis - Usually limited in time and power. Mostly used to 'suggest'
              actions to an unconfident or nervous individual. Thought to
              require eye contact.
 * Flight - Full vampires have bat-like wings that they disguise magically
            in the presence of humans. This enables them to glide for short
            distances and travel more quickly than unaided humans.


Others - like control of elemental magics - are typically learnable by normal
humans, although the time and effort needed is typically far greater than for
a vampire. Where humans need to learn to detect magical currents, vampires
seem to have an intuitive knack for it, and there is some evidence to indicate
that some humans have intentionally become vampires out of frustration with
their difficulties mastering magic as a shortcut.

== Miscellaneous ==

Several historically prominent and particularly well-esteemed wizards are
known to have lived to unusually old ages before disappearing suddenly, leading
several scholars to independently conclude that they were actually vampires.
Edward Jan Vilsgaard is noted for his contributions to armor durability and
catapult technology, which historians agree was a major factor behind his home
kingdom of Kaldania's stunning and unexpected triumph over the forces of
the self-titled Victor the Magnanimous six centuries ago. In a famous painting,
"Day Hawks," painted 540 years later and depicting a caf√© and its customers in
the early hours of the morning, features a man with a stunning likeness to the
old conjurer, all the way down to the large scar on his left cheek he obtained
in his youth. This and several other sightings in works of art have lead some
vampires to the conclusion that his magical gift came from becoming a vampire,
and that he left Kaldania rather than be discovered as an immortal being.
They suspect that he has been enjoying a long retirement and is simply taking
a moment every decade or two to 'painting-bomb' a scene when he sees an artist
on the streets.
